Vue components that act as an interface to Leaflet, EsriLeaflet and Esri (4x) objects. These components strive to have the same signature as their respective objects (inputs and outputs). Talking between components becomes simplified through either shared state (Vuex) or an event bus.

This is an extension of an already existing package called [Vueaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vueaflet/core)

* [README for @vue-mapp-kit/leaflet](https://github.com/matt-e-king/vue-mapp-kit/tree/master/packages/leaflet)
* [README for @vue-mapp-kit/esri-leaflet](https://github.com/matt-e-king/vue-mapp-kit/tree/master/packages/esri-leaflet)

NPM packages will be published soon to replace Vueaflet.
