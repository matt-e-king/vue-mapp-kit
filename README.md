# vue-mapp-kit #

Vue components that act as an interface to Leaflet, EsriLeaflet and Esri (4x) objects. These components strive to have the same signature as their respective library's objects/classes (inputs and outputs). Talking between components becomes simplified through either global state (Vuex) or a built-in event bus.
